-- binary_search(v.begin(), v.end(), key):
        -- Searches for a key in a sorted vector using binary search.
        -- This function returns true if the element is present in the container, else returns false.

-- lower_bound(v.begin(),v.end(),key):
        -- Returns pointer to the position of key if the container contains only one occurrence of key.
        -- Returns a pointer to the first position of key if the container contains multiple occurrences of key.
        -- Returns pointer to the position of a number just higher than key, if the container does not contain an occurrence of key.
        -- Subtracting the first position i.e vect.begin() from the pointer, returns the actual index.

-- upper_bound(v.begin(),v.end(),key):
        -- Returns pointer to the position of next higher number than key if the container contains one occurrence of key.
        -- Returns pointer to the first position of the next higher number than the last occurrence of key if the container contains multiple occurrences of key.
        -- Returns pointer to position of next higher number than key if the container does not contain an occurrence of key.

        NOTE - in every case upper bound returns the next higher element only.
